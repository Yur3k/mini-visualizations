# Mini Visualizations
## *A Collection of small Python demos that draw fractals, mazes, etc.*

Written in Python using Pygame and Tkinter.

**DISCLAIMER 1:** These projects were coded up a couple of years ago, and are extremely non-representative of my skills today. I do not recommend looking at the code.

**DISCLAIMER 2:** Some of these projects were written using Tkinter, which was a poor choice. Tkinter is intended for developing GUI's and keeps track of every single object drawn onto the screen. I recommend using Pygame for projects like these.
